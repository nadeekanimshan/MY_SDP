                Considering the fact that,  the world now is on a rapid growth curve upwards and how even the 
                smallest of the day-to-day tasks are becoming dependent on technology, I think it is fair to say we, 
                as a race of beings, have come a long way from the start of evolution. Modern technology, from 
                personalized streaming recommendations to virtual assistants, has become an inseparable part of 
                our daily lives. <br><br>
                For any of these remarkable revolutions to happen, one must always consider what made these 
miracles happen. What kind of supreme yet subtle entity was able to create these technological 
marvels for the latter. Of course, it is none other than the human brain, which could be considered 
one of nature's most extraordinary creations. Then in the amidst of all technological marvels lies 
Neural networks, inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neurons in that very 
extraordinary brain. This article focuses on discussing what Neural networks are, how they are used 
as solutions for modern problems and how they are impacting both the present and future of the 
world as an innovative milestone. <br><br>
What is Neural network technology? Basically, neural networks are groups of units(neurons) which 
are interconnected and can send signals to each other. They can either be biological or 
mathematical. In machine learning and deep learning, an artificial mathematical model is 
implemented, and these Neural networks consist of nodes which are the processing units of the 
network. They receive and send data to each other mimicking the exact workflow of the brain, where 
neurons pass electrical signals to each other. <br><br>
The Artificial Neural  network may consist of an input layer, an output layer and then some hidden 
layers. The two stages of the basic process in a neural network are recognized as Backpropagation 
and forward propagation. While Forward propagation processes input data layer by layer to produce 
an output, backpropagation corrects errors to improve accuracy. Meaning, Neural networks learn by 
making predictions, comparing them to actual outcomes, and adjusting themselves to improve 
accuracy, much like how a student corrects mistakes while studying. <br><br>
With Forward propagation, the layers play each of their own part to make the model work as it is 
intended. The input layer as its name suggests, receives input. The relevant hidden layer neuron 
processes inputs by multiplying their weights. Weights are measured for connections between each 
neuron, and they can vary throughout the training of the neural network model. You could think of 
weights as some sound control dials determining the output sound of speakers of a stereo.  <br><br>
The inputs are then added, passed through an activation function. An activation function acts as a 
switch for a light bulb, determining whether the bulb should switch on or off according to given power 
input. The exact purpose for doing this is to introduce non-linearity, which would enable network to 
recognize complicated patterns. The final output is created after repeating the process until the 
output layer is reached. 
<br><br>
Then with backward propagation the network starts comparing the predictions it made to actual 
results using a loss function. A loss function is a mathematical function that measures how well a 
neural network’s predictions align with the actual target values. For a common example, during a 
regression analysis of a continuous data value set, Mean Squared Error also known as MSE is used 
as a loss function. Binary Cross Entropy, also known as Log Loss, could be used as a common loss 
function for predicting discrete categories of data sets. The backward propagation calculates the rate 
of changes(Gradients) of the above-mentioned loss function with respect to each weight using chain 
rule of calculus. The chain rule of calculus allows you to compute the derivative of a function that is 
formed by applying one function to the result of another. Finally, the gradients are used to adjust 
weights as mentioned above, optimizing the neural network.   <br><br>
In an article like this, it would be a shame not to mention its use cases and scenarios in various 
domains. First, Neural networks play a huge part in Image and Video processing. For an example 
neural network are used for facial recognition, image enhancement or for deepfake creations. Also, 
neural networks are trained and developed for Natural Language Processing, where the model can 
be deployed for language translating, virtual assistants and content generation. The best example 
scenario is using ChatGPT to develop content or enhance text. Here a user may prompt what he 
desires, and the assistant will provide a simple yet sufficient solution for the user.   <br><br>
Furthermore, Neural networks are implemented in the health care sector as well. For diagnosis of 
patient medical records like X-Rays, MRIs, CT scans, these models can be used. As previously 
mentioned, when the neural network models get trained to analyze new data and do predications, 
recommendations, therefore workflows could be much easier and simpler to handle as well. 
Google’s DeepMind’s AI which is used for Eye disease and kidney detection is an example for this. <br><br>
Also, in the finance sector, neural networks can be used as predicative models as well. For a 
company to predict stock prices or to detect fraudulent reports made by employees according to 
budget histories…these are some example cases where neural networking model could be used. For 
example, PayPal uses neural networks to analyze transaction patterns and fraud detection, provide 
personalized offers and suggestions to users based on their transaction history and behavior etc. as 
well. <br><br>
And of course, neural networks are used in autonomous vehicles as well. Here sensors of a vehicle 
can get feedback from outside roads, for example, traffic lights or road conditions. Then the 
autonomous system will predict and decide which road, or which time would be the most convenient 
for the driver or passenger to take their trip, without having to ponder about a decision. A real-life 
example can be seen as the infamous Tesla Autopilot system, which is a revolutionary  idea by Elon 
Musk,  a brilliant mind of the modern era of technology.
<br><br>
In the education sector,  these neural networks can play a crucial role as well, language translating, 
implementing personalized learning students as such. Also, Neural networks are used in Agriculture 
for optimizing crop yield protection, for energy conservation and especially public safety as well. So 
basically, neural network models could be used for certain sectors which require analyzing specific 
data and giving predictions, recommendations, detailed statistical reports and other important data 
as well.  <br><br>
Now with neural networks being developed, these innovative technologies are used in various cases 
and scenarios to make tasks and operations easier. A suitable example could be that the raw human 
interactive work that could cost time could be saved with implementing neural networks. These 
neural network models will learn certain patterns through iterative workloads and with newfound 
knowledge and pattern recognition. Then the models can provide solutions for complex problems in 
a far more efficient manner compared to a human. Thus, making day-to-day tasks much easier and 
more practical to handle.  <br><br>
But that doesn’t always necessarily mean that neural networks cannot have their own limitations and 
problems as well. For starters, Data dependency and data integrity, data security can be considered 
as a major concern. If a data breach, a data theft or a data access by any unauthorized third party 
happens, security issues can arise, and privacy concerns will be problematic as well. Since neural 
networks are dependent on  data here, it is a major concern that must be considered as well. Also, 
the so-called Black-Box Nature of neural networks could be a problem as well. The randomness and 
the way neural networks arrive at specific decisions, it is hard to depend solely on these models in 
sensitive, high-stake sectors like health care, finance and legal systems.(Less transparency causes 
doubtful decisions) <br><br>
As for the future impact from the neural networks, these could actually enhance and push 
boundaries for human creativity and efficiency. Imagine where fully autonomous transport vehicles, 
enhanced intelligent personal assistant chatbots with 100% accuracy, a proper financial forecasting 
system, disaster prevention systems or maybe  fully utilized management systems for companies. A 
world we have only seen through movies, right before our very own eyes and presence, making lives 
far better for society. While improving the already enhanced model, it should always be kept in mind 
that ethical  and fair implementation of neural networks must be considered as well. <br><br>
And implementing neural networks into already happening day-to-day tasks, these technologies 
must always be used as  collaborating partners with humans and not as replacements for humans. 
We already are looking at a bright future with technology. As a generation we, now and will need to 
carefully implement these technologies, so that as a whole society we can benefit from them, all the 
while safeguarding future generations and maintaining a sustainable development in  technology. <br><br>
