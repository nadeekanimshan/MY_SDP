                The use of codes is very significant today in solving the problem of protection of 
information that is being transmitted through digital form and in storage. However, in a relatively 
new and rapidly developing science such as quantum computing puts itself a critical threat to 
current methods of cryptography especially asymmetric encryption techniques that depend on a 
virtual impossibility of solving certain mathematical problems. Quantum computers that are 
created on the framework of quantum mechanics solve some kinds of problems faster than classical 
computers and, therefore, compromise traditional cryptographic protocols. This article discusses 
how the emergence of quantum computing will affect cryptography and what measures are being 
made to protect data in a quantum world.  <br><br>
Quantum computing operate on principles of quantum mechanics which are responsible 
for physical features affecting matter and energy at micro and nano scale. Again, unlike classical 
computers that work with the smallest input or binary data which is a0 or 1, the quantum computers 
employs what are known as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum states of qubits can be living in two 
or more states at the same time because of superposition and entanglement and thus, make quantum 
computers become more efficient than classical ones in solving particular problems (Mavroeidis 
et al., 2018). This different way of computing provides a potential for a quantum computer to solve 
problems that are unrealistic when solved by a classical computer. <br><br>
In contrast, cryptography refers to the process by which information is made secure for 
only a particular holder, with its content only intelligible once the correct code is provided. It 
enhances the protection of numerous trivial interactions with digital environments, for example, 
financial operations, messaging, and data archiving. With most of today’s cryptographic systems 
depending on the difficulty of computational problems, they include large prime factorization 
(RSA) or Discrete Logarithm Problem (Elliptic Curve Cryptography, ECC). These problems are 
difficult to solve with classical computers hence making the encrypted data more secure (Boneh 
& Castro, 2018). <br><br>
The most commonly used cryptography technique for establishing public key 
infrastructure, such as the RSA and ECC algorithms, has significant vulnerabilities to be breached 
2 
by Quantum computers. Shor’s algorithm introduced in 1994 can be used to attack factorization 
and discrete logarithm and it is demonstrably faster than classical algorithm. The practical 
implications of this are severe: when large quantum computers are commercialized, they pose a 
threat to cryptosystems used to secure data such as, financial transfers, digital signatures, and 
communications (Boneh & Castro, 2018). <br><br>
The United States of America’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
have noted the risks that quantum computing present, and are busy researching potentially more 
robust encryption mechanisms that could not yield to a quantum attack. While asymmetric 
encryption systems will be the most directly impacted, symmetric encryption schemes also face 
challenges, though to a lesser extent. <br><br>
As it has been described while using suitably symmetric encryption above, in general, 
symmetric encryption is more secure against quantum attacks, but it is never completely safe. 
Grover’s algorithm can bring about the reduction of the security of only those symmetric 
encryption algorithms known in quantum computing once we introduce the former. Furthermore, 
Grover’s algorithm assists quantum computers to perform a search of unsorted databases much 
faster than classical computers. In the context of symmetric encryption, what that means is that 
while using a quantum computer it is possible to reduce the actual key size of some algorithms 
like the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). For example, there is a difference of security as 
that of AES-128 against an adversary with quantum technology capabilities (Boneh & Castro, 
2018).  <br><br>
While there are concerns laid, it is believed that symmetric algorithms will continue to be 
more secure than asymmetric algorithms in the era of quantum. Therefore, one of the strategies is 
to raise the key length used in symmetric encryption algorithms sufficiently to offset the 
penetration of the quantum algorithms the reduced security margin. <br><br>
Quantum computing is a considerable threat with regards to the present cryptographic 
systems, and due to this, there is a new field popularly called post-quantum cryptography, that is, 
creating cryptographic systems which can survive a quantum attack. To handle the quantum threat 
there are various families of potentially suitable algorithms which scientists focused their attention: 
3 
lattice-based, hash-based, and code-based cryptography. Of these, lattice-based cryptographic 
mechanism has potential not susceptible to classical and quantum computing attacks. Indeed, the 
complexity of some lattice problems renders them intractable for quantum computers, qualifying 
lattice-based schemes as promising candidates for upcoming cryptographic profiles (Mavroeidis 
et al., 2018).  <br><br>
NIST is cooperating with other industry groups to develop quantum-resistant algorithms 
and is presently benchmarking a number of contenders. This effort is important to guarantee that 
future cryptographic paradigm will not be vulnerable to threats posed by quantum computing.  <br><br>
The other way that can be used in the quantum era is referred to as quantum cryptography. 
Among all these techniques, one of the most known is the quantum key distribution (QKD) 
technique. QKD impacts the principles of quantum mechanics to help two parties to exchange a 
secret key such that any attempt to intercept the key exchange should enhance the alarm. For the 
reason that, quantum state is actually measured when an intruder is reported due to measuring a 
quantum state (Easttom, 2019). <br><br>
Although QKD has been implemented in certain specific usages, including the protection 
of government and banking communications, mainly due to its secure coding ability, the general 
application of quantum cryptography has encountered some issues. These include the need for 
better and more efficient quantum hardware, platform, and capability of maintaining a high level 
of security in long haul communication. While until now, quantum technologies are still under 
development, quantum cryptography may yet have a significant future in the sphere of data 
protection (Mosca, 2018).  <br><br>
In conclusion, quantum computing is a threat as well as the opportunity for the field of 
cryptography. Thus, it is known that many of todays used cryptographic systems, mainly due to 
their asymmetric encryption basis like RSA or ECC, can be broken by quantum computers. 
Although there is a threat, on the other hand, with the advancement in Quantum computing new 
form of cryptography have been developed which includes Post Quantum cryptography and 
Quantum Key Distribution that aim to manage the problem of securing digital communication in 
Quantum era. It is expected that as the quantum technology develops people will use both, 
4 
quantum-safe mathematical algorithms and quantum improvement methods to protect data from 
various malicious attacks in the future.  <br><br>
