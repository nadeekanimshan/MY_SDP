Imagine that you can travel across time 
and get a glimpse of your childhood. 
How wonderful that time was! Every so 
often you were at the park, playing with 
friends in the evening, cracking jokes and 
preserving cherished moments. But, have 
you ever wondered that your joyful, 
pleasurable and cheerful childhood would 
never be the same as the many of the 
youngsters today? Unfortunately, the 
modern generation of kids is not lucky 
enough to feel the happiness of playing with 
friends and hasn’t much time to take a 
breath of fresh air while enjoying the 
environment. They are hardly inclined to 
physical activities compared with earlier 
generations. As many are aware, it is not 
because of their fault. This occurred 
gradually with the evolution of modern 
technology.

                Upon closer inspection what’s fascinating is 
that Technology, especially Information 
Technology is the process of solving 
problems, 
accomplishing goals and 
enhancing our lifestyle. In simple terms, 
Technology is the tool to ease our lives. 
Then how it could harden our lifestyle? roof. According to modern research, many 
children around the world get addicted to 
smartphones extremely badly. Furthermore, 
nowadays when it comes to a teenage boy 
who has fallen for a girl, he is always trying 
to chat with her via messages except talking 
with her eye-to-eye. Sometimes people use 
social media to spread fake news and try to 
embarrass people. Despite these things, 
there are a lot of unhealthy lifestyle habits 
practised by the bad use of technology.

                As we delve into the details it is crystal 
clear that people, especially children make 
use of information technology to get 
unwanted stuff rather than useful stuff. 
Hence the responsibility of the parents 
should be to set limits for their children on 
using digital devices and let them spend 
their leisure time with friends and have 
some enjoyable time. <br><br>
Modern research shows the benefits of a 
simple lifestyle with highly demand fields 
like IT. Data science analysts, software 
developers, cyber security specialists and 
IT consultants usually work remotely while 
they can use information technology and do 
their occupations and live a simple life as 
much as possible. The government and 
private sector companies should promote 
job opportunities which are more inclined 
to a simple lifestyle. They should also show 
people the value of a simple lifestyle 
beyond the obsession with technology. In 
addition, government organizations and 
non-government organisations have to hold 
awareness programs affiliated with media <br><br>
From the wheel which was invented by 
ancient Mesopotamians, to the latest 
smartphone technology was developed 
significantly to a huge extent as we all are 
living in a Global village. It is no wonder 
that we can get vast amounts of information 
on the internet regarding any subject within 
seconds. 
Additionally, 
Facebook, 
WhatsApp, YouTube and other social 
media applications pave the way to the 
latest news around the world. We can 
communicate quickly and easily with very 
less 
amount of money, thanks to 
information technology. People can do 
business online and it saves time and 
energy. Hence there is no denying that 
without technology human beings are 
hopeless in the present day. So, how is the 
technology which is intended to be used for 
our easiness made our lives so toughen? It 
is because, the people who are using the 
technology, made the way of using it more 
complicated. <br><br>
At the beginning of the day, the very first 
thing we used to do was dip our heads into 
the phones to check what messages we got 
and what the latest news was. From that 
point onwards sometimes our minds fill 
with sorrow if it is a piece of bad news. It 
may lead us the whole day with anxiety and 
stress. Back in the early days, children 
spend their leisure time playing outdoor 
games, making kites and on occasion 
squabbling with siblings. But nowadays, 
children are spending most of their leisure 
time playing video games and scrolling 
social media apps for hours. Parents and 
children are like strangers under the same 
partners on how to make life easier with the 
use of technology instead of getting it as a 
burden.

                Some organizations have already made 
                Physical Activity and Sport Participation 
                frameworks to uplift the lifestyles of the 
                people while living in a modernised world 
                which is submerged in technology. <br><br>
                Digging deeper, we may see living a simple 
life while using technology is impossible. 
But as an individual, we can do a lot by 
stepping one step at a time. We can set 
limitations for ourselves and keep away the 
digital devices as much as possible. We can 
use information technology for essential 
things instead of generating all the stuff that 
we want. From that, we can improve our 
creativity little by little and by that, we do 
not have to rely on any kind of a generative 
AI full-time. It is high time to take 
responsibility and take the first step towards 
a better, simpler life with the help of 
information technology and not be a prey 
for the technology. Then we can say “life is 
as much as easier, when apple and 
blackberry  were just fruits”.
