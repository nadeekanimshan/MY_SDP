            <p>What if I were to tell you that we as a species are at a crossroad?  Where one road leads to a 
                utopia and the other to a dystopia. In this article, I invite you to explore with me the future 
                that awaits. The immense potential as well as the deep pitfalls. I’ll give you a hint. It involves 
                “Industry 4.0” and an idealistic vision. </p>

            <h2>The Change: A New Era Unfolds</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The change, that’s rightly dubbed industry 4.0, has already taken up steam and gained 
                widespread attention with the much-hyped AI wave from 2022. It is now common to see AI 
                everywhere, so much so that AI has become a marketing buzzword. However, though the 
                most influential, AI is not the only game in town. </p>
            <p>Industry 4.0 brings a smart lifestyle. Internet of Things (IOT) is turning everything smart and 
                interconnected. IOT devices are essentially a collection of sensors that continuously collect 
                data, a low-power microprocessor or a microcontroller, as well as networking components 
                used to send the data to a central platform for further analysis and decision-making.  For 
                example, IOT devices in agriculture can monitor soil moisture, weather conditions, pests, 
                etc. Which helps farmers detect potential issues in real time, thus enabling them to respond 
                fast to complications. AI systems can be used here to automate data processing and suggest 
                the necessary steps. In manufacturing, IOT is coupled with digital twins, which are virtual 
                simulations of machines in a factory, and AI to make intelligent systems that predict 
                machine failures before they occur and decide the best timeframe for maintenance to 
                reduce downtime. The system also synchronizes the operation of every machine in the 
                factory and automatically adjusts workflows and reassign tasks when a particular machine 
                is failing. Companies like Samsung, Siemens and General Electric already benefit from this. 
                Big Data, which is another emerging technology, can make informed predictions on complex 
                cases like market trends. It can also be used to perform research by analyzing large amounts 
                of data that would have taken human researchers years. AI and Machine learning can make 
                intelligent robots that learn from the environment and experiences and develop itself a much 
                more capable and complex AI. There are many such technologies on their way to being 
                integrated with our lives. <br><br>These changes are being discussed around the world, with different perspectives and 
                questions. However, the most significant question of all is, have we really understood their 
                extent? 
                </p>

            <br>
            <h2>The Extent: What Can Truly Be?</h2><br>
            <p>If these technologies reach their full potential, the future awaiting is a page out of a science 
                fiction. These technologies go hand in hand and improve each other’s capabilities. They are 
                general purpose, meaning they can be integrated into anything and everything.  For example, 
                A smart factory will require a minimal workforce and by using IOT and big data, it will know 
                how many of their products are left in the market and will adjust production accordingly. The 
                machinery will have a synchronized workflow and know when maintenance is required. In 
                the future, Smart, general-purpose robots will be doing tasks humans did. AI will fill 
                administrative roles such as data entry. AI and Big data will be used to make informed 
                decisions and predictions. However, it is doubtful if these technologies will become 
                widespread in their full potential. Though whatever the case, we can be sure that a complete 
                transformation is coming. Which on one hand means opportunities. It’s not an exaggeration 
                to say that entrepreneurs are looking at a wave of opportunities to what the dotcom era 
                brought and It’s possible for new players to come out on top. An example is OpenAI 
                outperforming the AI leaders at the time, namely Google, Amazon and Microsoft. <br><br>Though on the other hand, it presents difficulties, the most noteworthy is massive job 
                displacement. Both blue-collar and white-collar. Some argue that the overall impact will be 
                minimal as the change will create new jobs, referring to the change automation brought 
                towards the end of the last century. However, automation back then could only be integrated 
                into specific industries like manufacturing, agriculture and logistics. Now, automation 
                coupled with AI, can be implemented to almost any industry, Robots no longer need to be 
                built for specific tasks. Instead, AI can integrate a general-purpose robot into a specific role.  
                For example, Optimus is a robot designed by Tesla to assist in general tasks in industries like 
                manufacturing as well as home automation. Pepper by SoftBanks is designed for hospitality 
                and customer care while NAO focuses on Education and Research. AI alone can replace 
                many job roles from customer service, data entry to even data analysis and software 
                development. In short, the extent of the applications is massive and can be easily 
                implemented in any sector in a rather short time. AI models like GPT by OpenAI, can be 
                modified to cater for different job roles. I would argue that a fitting analogy to what can 
                happen is what happened to the role of horses with the arrival of automobiles. 
                <br><br>According to the World Economic Forum and McKinsey, the impact will be significant, even 
                reaching white-collar jobs. With the current economic model where companies focus on 
                profits, if left unchecked, there are two very concerning possibilities. Widespread integration 
                of AI and automation can lead to massive job displacement in a short time, which in turn 
                leads to economic recession. The other is technological integration may slow down or come 
                to a stalemate due to fear of economic impacts and government policies. This is where many 
                discussions are concerned with. And figuring a way out of this difficult situation is the 
                immediate concern. <br><br>
                Now that I have given you a glimpse of the utopia and the dystopia, I want to pause and shift 
                your focus towards something else, something less discussed and idealistic. For that, let me 
                take you through a journey through time. Starting at the very beginning. </p>

        <section><br>
            <h2>The Past: A Journey Through Time</h2><br>
            <p>In the beginning, Humans used to survive, focusing all their energy on finding food, mating 
                and leaving behind offsprings. Then, something remarkable happened. Humans began to 
                establish communities and began to invent many increasingly efficient tools to ease their 
                lives. They started to build settlements, farm and form social structures. Which gave rise to 
                things beyond basic survival, like complex art, music, ideas, religions, and gave humans the 
                peace of mind from constantly worrying about basic needs. Admittedly, most were not free 
                to pursue these interests and focused on making their living. Next, with larger civilizations, 
                even more pursuits came to be. Like philosophy, mathematics, engineering, art, 
                architecture, and politics. With renaissance these pursuits became more widespread. More 
                complex tools and concepts were invented, catering even for entertainment. But still, for 
                civilization to function, many people couldn’t be truly free to pursue these interests, nor did 
                many have the opportunity for education. Fast forward to the last century, we saw the rise of 
                modern education, opening the door for the masses to pursue these passions, modern 
                medicine kept most alive well into their 80s. Most importantly, the formation of modern 
                economies. It got everyone to work, although involuntarily and roughly, towards the 
                betterment of humanity. Workers focused on making a living for themselves and their 
                families while owners focused on making more profit. But to make profit, they had to produce 
                what humans wanted and so they did. This system worked and we thrived. Admittedly, some 
                much more than the others. <br><br>
                Throughout all these transformations, a common theme can be seen. Humans always 
                walked away from survival and towards making life easier and followed increasingly abstract 
                pursuits like art, intellectual purists, leisure, spiritualism. They showed immense potential 
                for that and with each transformation, more people gained easier lives and the chance to 
                follow their passions. However, for civilization to function, most of the people still needed to 
                work most of their time. The next transformation in line is what we discussed above, and I 
                would argue that this one has the potential to further these trends by leaps and bounds. </p>

        <section><br>
            <h2>A Dream for the Living</h2><br>
            <p>Imagine a life where we do not have to work more than 15 hours a week, a life where the 
                focus is on living and following our passions, be it leisure, art or intellectual pursuits. A life 
                where a person is not defined by their livelihood but by their passion, A life where all of us get 
                to experience what it means to be human, exploring our abilities to the limit. Basically, the 
                life we all imagined as children instead of the “The Reality”. This is what the economist John 
                Maynard Keynes envisioned in his 1930 essay "Economic Possibilities for Our 
                Grandchildren."  A life of abundance, leisure, and cultural enrichment for individuals. <br><br>
                These future technologies make exactly that possible. The potential loss of jobs means that 
                it is unnecessary for everyone to work all that time, there is no need for the pursuit of leisure 
                to be seen as lazy. Of course, We need to figure a way out of the immediate difficult situations 
                we discussed. While that is the reality, we can do so with this idealistic vision in mind. I would 
                argue that “the difficult situation” is actually an opportunity for the humanity to transform 
                into something more. <br><br>I 
                admit that it is a tall order involving many complex issues like addressing inequity, 
                redesigning the economy, redefining how work and the contribution to economy should take 
                place, and dealing with people benefitting from current status quo who wouldn’t want things 
                to change much.  <br><br>It is true that this vision seems unnecessary as the immediate issues like job displacement 
                are what feels real. However, if you take a few steps back and look at the bigger picture, it will 
                become clear that walking towards this sort of a dream, even with baby steps, was what 
                needed to be done in the first place and that in the face of the new technologies, this dream 
                has already become closer to reality.
